Better Beginnings Mod
=====================

Better Beginnings mod for Minecraft v1.8.x. Requires Forge (built with 11.14.4.1450).

Kind of complicated. See the [forum topic](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2192122-betterbeginnings-mod).

Source for 1.7.10 version:
--------------------------
Since IntelliJ doesn't exactly play nice with GitHub branches, I had to move the MC1.7 branch to [its own repository](https://github.com/einsteinsci/betterbeginnings-MC1.7). You can find it here. Issues for the 1.7.10 version should still be posted here.
